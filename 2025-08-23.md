## Discussion / Reflection

1. Of all the 3 points that were mentioned - "hearing", "loving" and "devotion", which is the hardest for you and why?

   - devotion - fully committing with single minded devotion
   - hearing - listen and obey
   - loving - "feeling" and "acting"

2. What is are some things that we can do as a cell, so that we can love God and each other better?
   - Reuben: Orphanage - To visit the children (?)
   - Joylynn: Going for prayer walks with church every 1st week of the month as a cell (4 times a year)
   - Shelly: Bracelet workshop for trafficked women w/ Hagar Singapore - 2025 (Date TBC)
   - Reuben: Cell group trip, w/ 3 hours per morning prayer + worship, then go hang out for the rest of the day, then end the day together w/ prayer (TBC)
     - 31st August - Reuben, Conrad, Pris not on duty. Shelly joining, Ps Benji preaching, Joy on duty.
   - Shelly: how can we improve the experience at the cafe for the community and believers - it's abit awkward for the people there to ask for funds when offering food, could do collection separately
