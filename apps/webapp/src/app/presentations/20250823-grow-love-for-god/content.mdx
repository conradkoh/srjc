## Discussion / Reflection

1. Of all the 3 points that were mentioned – "hearing", "loving" and "devotion", which is the hardest for you and why?
   - devotion – fully committing with single minded devotion
   - hearing – listen and obey
   - loving – "feeling" and "acting"
2. What are some things that we can do as a cell, so that we can love God and each other better?
   - Priscilla: Orphanage - To visit the children (?)
   - Joylynn: Going for prayer walks with church every 1st week of the month as a cell (4 times a year)
   - Shelly: Bracelet workshop for trafficked women w/ Hagar Singapore - 2025 (Date TBC)
   - Reuben: Cell group trip, w/ 3 hours per morning prayer + worship, then hang out, end day w/ prayer (TBC)
     - 31st August - Reuben, Conrad, Pris not on duty. Shelly joining, Ps Benji preaching, Joy on duty.
   - Shelly: How can we improve the experience at the cafe for the community and believers – it's a bit awkward for the people there to ask for funds when offering food; could do collection separately
