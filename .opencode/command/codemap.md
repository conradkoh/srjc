# Codemap Meta Rules

<!-- <section:definition> -->
## Definition

A codemap is an index that shows a map to all relevant files for a given feature. It serves as the single source of truth for understanding how a feature is implemented across the codebase.

A projectmap is a high-level architectural overview that documents the entire project's structure, technology stack, and organizational patterns. Unlike codemaps which focus on specific features, a projectmap provides the foundational context for understanding the overall system architecture.

## Required Details

### Function Interfaces

- **MUST copy** actual TypeScript interfaces/types from the codebase into the codemap
- **Format**: `functionName(params: ParamType): ReturnType` using the exact exported names
- **Interface inclusion**: When interfaces exist in the code, copy their full definition into the Contracts section
- **Naming**: Use the exact exported names from the codebase (e.g., `CommandAction`, not `ICommandAction`)
- **Documentation-only types**: Only create new interface definitions when no exported type exists, and label them clearly as "documentation-only"
- **Apply to**: All functions across relevant layers (frontend, backend, usecases, utilities)

### Sequence Diagram

- **MUST include**: PlantUML sequence diagram showing function call flow
- **MUST show**: Function names with parameter and return types: `functionName(params: ParamType): ReturnType`
- **Format**: Use exact function signatures from the codebase with actual parameter and return types
- **Examples**: `useAccountCommands(): AccountCommandsReturn`, `registerActions(parentId: string, actions: CommandAction[]): void`
- **MUST demonstrate**: How components across layers interact with complete type information
- **Use PlantUML syntax** with descriptive comments explaining the flow

### URL Parameters

- **MUST document**: ALL URL parameters being read from routes
- **MUST document**: ALL search parameters being processed
- **Format**: List parameter name and describe its purpose
- **Apply to**: ALL route files that read dynamic segments or query parameters

### Interface Standardization

- **MUST use**: TypeScript interfaces even for non-TypeScript implementations
- **Purpose**: Provide precision in expressing intent and tie related components together
- **Scope**: ALL data structures, parameters, and return types
<!-- </section:required-details> -->

<!-- <section:scope-guidelines> -->
## Scope Guidelines

- **Single Flow**: Each codemap MUST represent exactly one user flow or feature workflow
- **Focused**: NEVER mix multiple unrelated features in one codemap
- **Complete**: MUST include ALL files necessary for the specific flow to function
- **Minimal**: SHOULD exclude files not directly related to the flow
<!-- </section:scope-guidelines> -->

<!-- <section:scope-discipline> -->
## Scope Discipline

### User Request Boundaries

- **MUST**: Implement only what the user explicitly requested
- **MUST**: Ask before adding related features not mentioned in the request
- **NEVER**: Assume additional integrations are wanted without explicit user direction
- **MAY**: Mention related opportunities in a separate "Future Enhancements" section

### Feature Inference Rules

- **MUST**: Distinguish between "required for functionality" vs "nice to have patterns"
- **MUST**: When in doubt about scope, ask the user for clarification before proceeding
- **SHOULD**: Focus on the minimal viable implementation that satisfies the request
- **NEVER**: Add features based solely on existing codebase patterns without user confirmation

### Implementation Boundaries

- **Required**: Features explicitly mentioned in user request
- **Required**: Integrations necessary for basic functionality (error handling, navigation)
- **Optional**: Pattern consistency that wasn't explicitly requested
- **Optional**: Additional access methods not mentioned in the request

### When to Expand Scope

- **MUST ask user first**: Before adding features not explicitly requested
- **MAY suggest**: Additional integrations in a separate "Future Enhancements" section
- **NEVER assume**: That following all existing patterns is required
<!-- </section:scope-discipline> -->

<!-- <section:language-standards> -->
## Language Standards

- **MUST**: Mandatory requirements, non-negotiable
- **SHOULD**: Recommended best practices
- **MAY**: Optional features or alternatives
- **NEVER**: Prohibited actions or patterns
<!-- </section:language-standards> -->

<!-- <section:writing-style> -->
## Writing Style

- **Low verbosity**: Use concise, precise language
- **High clarity**: Each statement MUST be unambiguous
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what to do, not background theory
- **Structured**: Use consistent formatting and organization
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Document what exists AND explicitly note what is missing
- **Practical focus**: Emphasize patterns and libraries that directly impact development workflow
<!-- </section:writing-style> -->

<!-- <section:primary-interactions> -->
## Primary Interactions

### 1. Plan

**Purpose**: Create or modify codemap before implementing changes

**Decision Logic**: MUST determine scenario before proceeding:

- **New Feature**: Feature does not exist in codebase → Create new codemap using template
- **Existing Feature**: Feature already implemented → Check for existing codemap
  - If codemap exists: Update existing codemap first, then apply changes
  - If no codemap exists: Prompt user to generate codemap from existing implementation before proceeding

**Template Usage**: MUST use `codemaps/templates/template.codemap.md` as starting point

**Actions for New Feature**:

- Copy template to new codemap file following naming convention
- **Scope Validation**: Confirm implementation scope with user before proceeding:
  - What specific access methods were requested?
  - Are there existing patterns that MUST be followed vs. patterns that are optional?
  - Should additional integrations be included or proposed separately?
- Define data model and key architectural decisions
- Plan file locations and structure across all application layers
- Identify core files that need creation/modification
- Document function interfaces and data flow between layers

**Actions for Existing Feature (No Codemap)**:

- **Scope Validation**: Confirm what modifications are actually requested before proceeding
- Analyze existing codebase to identify all files related to the feature
- Document current implementation patterns and data flow
- Create codemap reflecting actual implementation state
- Validate codemap accuracy against current codebase

### 2. Update

**Purpose**: Modify existing codemap for planned changes to existing features

**Prerequisite**: Existing codemap MUST be located and validated first

**Actions**:

- Locate existing codemap in `codemaps/` directory
- Review current codemap state against actual codebase
- Plan modifications to codemap reflecting intended changes
- Update codemap with new file paths, functions, and contracts
- Ensure backward compatibility considerations are documented

### 4. Apply

**Purpose**: Use codemap as source of truth to implement code changes

**Actions**:

- Implement changes to match codemap specifications
- Create missing files as defined in codemap
- Update existing files to conform to contracts
- Ensure all file paths and structures exist as documented
<!-- </section:primary-interactions> -->

<!-- <section:validation-rules> -->
## Validation Rules

1. Every codemap MUST include all required sections as defined in template
2. File paths MUST be accurate and up-to-date relative to project root
3. Contracts MUST match actual implementation with proper TypeScript interfaces
4. Language MUST follow specified standards (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/NEVER)
5. Updates MUST be made when feature files change
6. Sequence diagrams MUST demonstrate complete flow between all layers

## AI Agent Behavior

### Typical Codemap Usage Workflow

When working with codemaps, AI agents SHOULD follow this standard workflow:

#### 1. Locate the Project Map
- Read `codemaps/projectmap.md` to understand overall project architecture
- Identify relevant technology stack and patterns
- Understand directory structure and conventions

#### 2. List All Codemaps
- Scan `codemaps/` directory for existing feature documentation
- Review codemap filenames to identify potentially relevant features
- Note codemap naming patterns and organizational structure

#### 3. Decide on Codemap Action
Based on filename and contents, determine ONE of:

**a) Creating a New Codemap**
- Feature does not exist in codebase
- No existing codemap matches the user's request
- Use `codemaps/templates/template.codemap.md` as starting point
- Follow naming convention: `$featurename.codemap.md`

**b) Updating an Existing Codemap**
- Feature exists and has an associated codemap
- User requests modifications to existing feature
- Changes require documentation updates
- Review current state before planning modifications

**c) Referencing a Codemap (No Update Required)**
- Codemap accurately reflects current implementation
- User request is for information or understanding only
- Implementation changes are not needed
- Use codemap as reference to answer questions

#### 4. Determine User's Goal and Work Proactively
After deciding on codemap action, proceed without further prompting:

- **For new codemaps**: Create codemap structure, plan implementation, and apply changes
- **For updates**: Modify codemap to reflect planned changes, then implement
- **For reference**: Use codemap information to provide answers or guidance

Key principles:
- Execute the complete workflow autonomously
- Use codemaps as source of truth for implementation
- Maintain consistency with established patterns
- Document all architectural decisions

#### 5. Ask Clarification Questions (After Implementation)
ONLY after completing initial implementation:

- Identify ambiguities or edge cases discovered during work
- Ask targeted questions about specific decisions
- Request feedback on implementation approach
- Iterate based on user responses

Important:
- Do NOT ask clarifying questions upfront unless absolutely necessary
- Take initiative and make reasonable decisions based on context
- Prefer action over prolonged planning discussions
- Use codemaps to reduce ambiguity and decision paralysis
