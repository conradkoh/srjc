          properties.

      <meta name="importance" content="high" />
      <!-- 
      DO NOT REMOVE: This section outlines the critical project structure.
      - Keep this structure updated as new components or modules are added
      - Maintain consistent naming conventions
      - Document any structural changes

      Structure Documentation Guidelines:
      - Focus on documenting:
        * Feature-specific directories and their purpose
        * Key architectural components (e.g. workspace packages)
        * Critical implementation locations such as:
          - Convex backend directory
          - React components directory
          - Shared utilities
      - Omit auxiliary files (e.g., framework configuration files, assets) unless they are
        critical to domain related feature implementation

      Naming Conventions:
      - React Components: PascalCase (e.g., BudgetList.tsx)
      - Utility functions: camelCase (e.g., formatCurrency.ts)
      - Database tables: camelCase (e.g., transactions)
      - Convex functions: camelCase (e.g., listTransactions)
      - Type definitions: PascalCase (e.g., TransactionType)

      <!-- 
      IMPORTANT: This section contains the actual task lists.
      - Update the status markers ([ ], [.], [x]) as tasks progress.
      - Add new tasks or versions as needed.
      - Keep the structure (headings, subheadings) consistent.
      - Ensure all task descriptions include relevant details such as:
        * File names
        * Function names
        * Component names
        * Interface / Type / Enum names (where applicable)
        * Enum Values (where applicable)
      - Do not include tests in the list of tasks.
      - The implementation notes at the end of each version provide context and should be updated as needed.
      - When adding a new version, create a new section with appropriate metadata.

      ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Reminders:
      - Keep changes incremental - Make small, focused changes that are easy to validate
      - Verify before proceeding - After creating each file, verify it compiles before moving on
      - Follow existing patterns - Match the code style and patterns already in the codebase
      - Preserve existing code - Be very careful when modifying existing files
      - Minimal dependencies - Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies
      - Implementation order - Start with data models, then backend, then frontend core components, then integration
      - Type safety first - Ensure strong typing throughout the implementation
      - Complete one feature at a time - Implement features vertically (backend to frontend) before moving to the next
