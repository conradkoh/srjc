# What are you thirsting for?

## **Matthew 5:6**

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,

for they will be filled.

## Defining what is “good” to you

- Time: if didn’t have to work, what would you regularly spend time on?
- Money: if money was no restriction, and you have bought everything you could possibly buy for yourself. what would you do with the rest?

## Blindness of hunger

Blindness is defined as the inability to see. Applying the metaphor to a real context, we often do not perceive because of

1. Lack of attention / distraction - we focus on shiny things that are not valuable
2. Emotion - we what triggered how we feel and discard valuable information
3. Lack of foresight - focus on short term gains rather than long term goals

**Hunger is not a bad thing**

Hunger is the sub-conscious driving force for action. It is also something that is we cannot immediately control at any given moment, but is more a reflection of our state.

- It reveals useful information to us
- It guides our actions and cannot go unignored indefinitely

Hunger blindness is thus characterized by the following:

- Regret: You decided and later regret it
- Missing information: Your regret came when more information was revealed

## Discussion Questions

- What is one hunger that drives your thoughts and guides your actions that you think is unhealthy?

## Hungering / Thirsting for righteousness

The main fault of Hunger Blindness comes from the regret. We received more **information** that revealed the flaw in our decision making, and we then wish for more **information** to solve the problem for the future - although it is often unrealistic to

1. Have ALL the information
2. Correctly process ALL the information - even if we did have it

The bible gives us a way out with a burden that is light:

### *Psalm 37:23-24*

*The steps of a man are established by the LORD,
And He delights in his way*

*When he falls, he will not be hurled headlong,
Because the LORD is the One who holds his hand*

### Drinking from the right “well"

The solution to a problem of our thirst can be as simple as going to the well and taking a drink of water. The question is - which well are we drinking from? Here are some wells:

- **Faith vs knowledge**
*Example: When we regret an action, do we think “if only I knew xxx” or do we think “I should have prayed about it”?*
- **Strength vs Humility**
*Example: When we encounter an insurmountable challenge (e.g. a health problem, a relationship issue), do we think “I’m so tired, I tried everything” or do we pour our hearts out to God and ask for help?*
- **Flesh vs Spirit**
*Example: Do we find peace / comfort in material things or food, rather than in Spiritual things like prayer and communion with God and His people?*

### Actionable steps

Do we hunger and thirst for righteousness? If we did, how would that affect both our introspection and our outlook?

A person who thirsts for righteousness:

- Aims to live righteously
- Seeks communion with those who live righteously
- Desires to call the unbeliever to repentance
